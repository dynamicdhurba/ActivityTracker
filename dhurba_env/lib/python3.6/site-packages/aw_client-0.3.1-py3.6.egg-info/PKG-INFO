        ## How to install
        
        To install the latest git version directly from github without cloning, run
        `pip install git+https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client.git`
        
        To install from a cloned version, cd into the directory and run
        `poetry install` to install inside an virtualenv. If you want to install it
        system-wide it can be installed with `pip install .`, but that has the issue
        that it might not get the exact version of the dependencies due to not reading
        the poetry.lock file.
