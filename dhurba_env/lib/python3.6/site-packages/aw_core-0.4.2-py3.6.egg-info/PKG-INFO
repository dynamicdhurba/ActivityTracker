        Core library for ActivityWatch.
        
        
        ## Modules
        
         - `aw_core`, contains basic datatypes and utilities, such as the `Event` class, helpers for configuration and logging, as well as schemas for buckets, events, and exports.
         - `aw_datastore`, contains the datastore classes used by aw-server-python.
         - `aw_transform`, all event-transforms used in queries.
         - `aw_query`, the query-language used by ActivityWatch.
        
        
        ## How to install
        
        To install the latest git version directly from github without cloning, run
        `pip install git+https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-core.git`
        
        To install from a cloned version, cd into the directory and run
        `poetry install` to install inside an virtualenv. If you want to install it
        system-wide it can be installed with `pip install .`, but that has the issue
        that it might not get the exact version of the dependencies due to not reading
        the poetry.lock file.
